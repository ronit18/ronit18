# Hi, I'm Ronit 👋
## Cybersecurity/DevSecOps/Developer 

Currently pursuing my M.Tech in Cybersecurity at Rashtriya Raksha University (RRU).

I use work for [eleics](https://github.com/eleics) as a software engineer and sys-admin building [iotdashboard](https://iotdashboard.in).

Here are some of my most interesting open source projects on GitHub:

- 🛠️ My [dotfiles](https://github.com/ronit18/dotfiles) are public and I've put
  a lot of effort into making them work well for me. Maybe there are some tricks
  in there that would work well for you too!
- 🪄 [oXocarbonix-vsc](https://github.com/ronit18/oXocarbonix-vsc) is a VS Code color theme inspired by the popular Neovim oxocarbon colorscheme. This extension provides two carefully crafted variants to suit different lighting conditions and preferences.
- :octocat: I've made minor contributions to some popular open source projects including
  - [ghostty-org/ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty),
  - [thingsboard/thingsboard](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard)
